The following is a Tableau worksheet that shows four KPIs for the Szeged, Hungary area, 2006-2016 dataset.
The four chosen KPIs are Average Apparent Temperature between 2006-2016, Percentage of Total Cloud Days,
Minimum Apparent Temperature While Raining, and Wind Speed Decreases Humidity by 50%. 

The first KPI chosen is Average Apparent Temperature.
This indicator will provide the audience with an average apparent temperature from 2006 to 2016. 
The average apparent temperature between 2006 and 2016 was 10.86°C. 
It is an important piece of information to help see the changes of average apparent temperatures 
throughout the years and will help predict possible future average apparent temperatures per year. 
The data visualization that was chosen here was a line graph. 

As for the second KPI, Percentage of Cloudy Days, this indicator was 
chosen because we wanted to show the total percentage of which type of weather was the most
common during the days between the years of 2006 and 2016.
This type of information will be shown using a bar graph since it is
best utilized for comparing entities. In this case, we are comparing different weather 
types that occurred during the days in the Szeged area between 2006 and 2016.

For the third KPI, Minimum Apparent Temperature while Raining, 
this indicator was chosen because we wanted to show the range of the apparent 
temperatures when it raining or snowing. Also, we noticed that the minimum apparent
 temperature data point while it was raining was -7.55 °C, which was very cold and 
below the freezing point.  The graph that we have chosen was the box plot graph. 
This type of graph allows us to best show the ranges of the temperatures during each 
precipitation type, as well as the five different number summaries, such as min, max, and median. 

Lastly, our fourth KPI, Wind Speed Decreases Humidity by 50%, 
was chosen because we wanted to show the relationship between Wind Speed and Humidity. 
The graph that we have chosen will be the line graph because it will best represent our 
KPI by showing the type of relationship the two metrics will have with each other. 
The line graph shows the average wind speed and average humidity change between 2006 and 2016. 
As a result, we got the blue average humidity line with a positive trend, while red average wind 
speed line has a negative trend from 2006. An average wind speed decreased from 10.8 km/h in 2006 to 
10.7 km/h in 2016. The total decrease is negative 8%.  As for the average humidity, it was 7.2 in 2006 
and increased to 7.5 in 2016, as a result showing 4% increase. The calculations above prove that average 
wind speed and average humidity are negatively related. As the average wind speed positively changes to 1 
unit, the average humidity negatively changes to 50%. Hence, average wind speed decreases average humidity
by 50%.
